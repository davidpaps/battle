# Battle

Week 3 Afternon Challenge at Makers. This was a collaborative exercise, pairing every day with a different member of the cohort. The objectives of the week were to learn to test drive a web app using the MVC pattern. This way my first ever project using the MVC Pattern, as well as my first time creating a web app - using Ruby and Sinatra to display the .erb files.

I have left this app as it was in week 3 to serve as a progress marker and to show how far I have come since. Although the styling is basic, it's functionality is solid. The whole app was Test Driven with good coverage (using capybara and RSpec), logic resides in the Model, Views displays the html code and the controller connects the two together, directing to the appropiate path.

**The functionality of the app:**

A user can enter their name, a second user can enter their name

Instantiate a new Docking Station
Instantiate a new Bike
Dock the Bike in the Docking Station
Release the Bike from the Docking Station
An error message will appear if the Max capacity is reached in a Docking Station and a Bike is docked
An error message will appear if there are no Bikes to release from a Docking Station
A user can confirm if the Bike they have released Is Working
A user can report if a Bike is Broken
